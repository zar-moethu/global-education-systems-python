# Clustering Analysis of Global Higher Education Systems using Python and Excel

## ðŸ“˜ Data Dictionary

This project uses a merged dataset combining international student mobility, higher education participation, globalisation indices, and institutional rankings. The following variables are used in this analysis:

| Variable Name            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `country_x`              | Country name (from the merged dataset)                                      |
| `InboundRatio`           | Inbound mobility rate for international students (% of tertiary enrolment) |
| `InternationalStudentsNO`| Total number of international students enrolled                             |
| `KOFPoGI`                | Political Globalisation Index (from KOF Globalisation Index)                |
| `KOFEcGI`                | Economic Globalisation Index                                                |
| `KOFSoGI`                | Social Globalisation Index                                                  |
| `ISCED5 Percentage`      | Participation in short-cycle tertiary education (ISCED Level 5)             |
| `ISCED6 Percentage`      | Participation in Bachelor's level tertiary education (ISCED Level 6)        |
| `ISCED7 Percentage`      | Participation in Master's level tertiary education (ISCED Level 7)          |
| `ISCED8 Percentage`      | Participation in Doctoral level tertiary education (ISCED Level 8)          |
| `top 50 count`           | Number of universities ranked in the QS Top 50                              |
| `top 100 count`          | Number of universities ranked in the QS Top 100                             |
| `top 500 count`          | Number of universities ranked in the QS Top 500                             |
| `top 1000 count`         | Number of universities ranked in the QS Top 1000                            |
| `WESP`                   | World Economic Situation and Prospects 2021 grouping or economic tier       |

**Note:**  
Other decomposed KOF indicators (e.g. KOFGIdf, KOFTrGIdj, etc.) exist in the full dataset but are not used in this study for simplicity and relevance. This project focuses on understanding how globalisation and higher education metrics relate to inbound student mobility and university rankings.
